### Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors 
This program attempts to open and read the contents of a file named `sample.txt`. It prints the file's contents line by line. 
The program also includes error handling to ensure that a user-friendly message is displayed if the file does not exist, instead of crashing the program.

### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
This program collects input from the user and writes it to a file named `output.txt`. 
It then allows the user to append additional text to the same file. 
Finally, it reads and displays the complete contents of the file, reflecting all entries.
